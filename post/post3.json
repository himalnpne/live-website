It’s a serious alternative to the big players like WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>\n\n<h2>🔐 Why Signal Stands Out</h2>\n<p>Let’s break down how Signal compares to WhatsApp on key privacy and security features:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Feature</th>\n      <th>Signal ✅</th>\n      <th>WhatsApp ❌</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>No Ads or Trackers</td>\n      <td>✅ Completely ad-free</td>\n      <td>❌ Owned by Meta, shows ads and collects data</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>End-to-End Encryption</td>\n      <td>✅ Default for all messages and calls</td>\n      <td>✅ Yes, but metadata is still collected</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Metadata Collection</td>\n      <td>✅ Minimal (just phone number & last active)</td>\n      <td>❌ Collects who you talk to, when, how often</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Open Source</td>\n      <td>✅ Fully open-source & audited</td>\n      <td>❌ Closed source</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Disappearing Messages</td>\n      <td>✅ Built-in with full control</td>\n      <td>⚠️ Limited options</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Data Ownership</td>\n      <td>✅ You own your data</td>\n      <td>❌ Meta uses your data for business</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>📦 Key Features at a Glance</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Zero Ads, Zero Trackers:</strong> Signal is run by a non-profit funded by donations, not advertisers.</li>\n  <li><strong>Strong Encryption:</strong> Uses the trusted Signal Protocol for all communications.</li>\n  <li><strong>Disappearing Messages:</strong> Set custom timers to auto-delete messages after they’re read.</li>\n  <li><strong>No Contact Storage:</strong> Signal doesn’t store your contacts on its servers.</li>\n  <li><strong>Screen Security:</strong> Prevents screenshots of chats on some platforms.</li>\n  <li><strong>Relay Calls:</strong> Hide your IP by relaying calls through Signal servers.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Available on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>💡 Why You Should Make the Switch</h2>\n<p>Most people think giving up privacy is the price of using modern tech—but it doesn’t have to be.
